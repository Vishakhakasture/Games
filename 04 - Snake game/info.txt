Snake game
A JavaScript grid-based game.

The player controls the snake's head, which moves forward continuously and can be steered left, right, up, 
and down. The goal is to eat apple and grow the snake as long as possible without hitting walls or the snake's 
own body.

I have used this javascript functions :

- event listeners
-> Event listeners are used to execute a function when a specific event occurs 
(e.g., a button click, mouse hover, or a keypress).

- query Selectors
-> Query selectors are used to select elements from the DOM based on CSS selectors.

- arrow functions
-> Arrow functions provide a concise way to write functions. They do not have their own this context.

- forEach
-> forEach is used to iterate over arrays or NodeLists.

- setting time intervals and countdowns
-> You can use setInterval and setTimeout for time-based tasks.

setTimeout: Executes a function after a specified delay.
setInterval: Executes a function repeatedly at regular intervals.
